# Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithm

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm, a well-known and efficient algorithm used to find the shortest path in a graph from a source node to all other nodes.

## Overview

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It's widely applied in various fields like computer networking, transportation, and maps to find the most optimal routes.

This implementation demonstrates how Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path in a graph. The algorithm guarantees the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes in the graph, given non-negative edge weights.

## Features

- **Finding Shortest Paths:** Calculates the shortest path from a specified source node to all other nodes in the graph.
- **Support for Weighted Graphs:** Handles graphs with weighted edges to determine optimal paths.
- **Simple and Understandable Implementation:** Provides a clear and straightforward implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
